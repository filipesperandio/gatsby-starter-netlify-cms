## Abstract

>   _Integrating spirituality into mental health care, psychiatry and psychotherapy is still controversial, albeit a growing body of evidence is showing beneficial
>    effects and a real need for such integration.
>    In this review, past and recent research as well as evidence from the integrative concept of a Swiss clinic is summarized._
 
>   _Religious coping is highly prevalent among patients with psychiatric disorders.
>    Surveys indicate that 70–80% use religious or spiritual beliefs and activities to cope with daily difficulties and frustrations.
>    Religion may help patients to enhance emotional adjustment and to maintain hope, purpose and meaning.
>    Patients emphasize that serving a purpose beyond one‘s self can make it possible to live with what might otherwise be unbearable._
 
>   _Programs successfully incorporating spirituality into clinical practice are described and discussed.
>    Studies indicate that the outcome of psychotherapy in religious patients can be enhanced by integrating religious elements into the therapy protocol and that this
>    can be successfully done by religious and non-religious therapists alike._
